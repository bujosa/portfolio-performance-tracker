# Portfolio Performance Tracker

## Description

You are tasked with creating a backend system that allows users to construct and track the performance of their portfolios based on a smart contract, similar to the concept of an "Amulet Vault."

The system should provide an API for users to input portfolio parameters, track the performance of their portfolios relative to another cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC or ETH), and display this information to a frontend application.
